# Spider Briber

This will be a HTML5 game, created during the #onegameamonth challenge.
It is based on HTML5 Boilerplate to ensure maximum compatibility.

The general idea is that you are a lord or similar. One day you wake up in your castle
and huge spiders have taken over your castle. Since you are in your bedroom you don't have
your weapon handy, but your trusty money bag handy.
Through causes that have yet to be determined the spiders are susceptible to bribery,
and so you can throw money at them to fend them off.
The game ends when you reach your weapon stash.

For now the whole "HTML5" part is in name only, because I don't really use any
features of HTML5 yet. But they will surely come (like sound, or using a canvas).
